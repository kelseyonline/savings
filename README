# Retirement 💸

retirement.py is a program intended to shame you into saving more. The user can input their age and how much they just spent, and the program will return both a pessimistic and optimistic estimate of what that purchase would have amounted to if it were invested instead. 


## Formula 

This program uses the Future Value Formula to estimate what the future value of an invested sum will be based on the rate of return and time horizon. 

#### Future Value Formula: 

```
FV = PV(1 + r)^t
```

* FV: future value 

* PV: present value 
 
* r: "interest" (average annualized rate of return in this case)

* t: time (in years)


## Pessimistic vs optimistic estimate 

#### Pessimistic 

The pessimistic estimate uses a 6% annualized rate of return, which many online calculators use to determine returns on the stock market. This is more conservative than the historical rate of return and paints a more 'bad case scenario' picture. 

#### Optimistic 

The optimistic estimate uses a 10% annualized rate of return, which is the historial average of the S&P 500 over the past century. This is a little bit more 'good case scenario' picture, but is still realistic.
